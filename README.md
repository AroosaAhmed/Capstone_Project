# Capstone_Project
This project is made with unity, by me and one other group member during game development bootcamp. My task in this project was coding so creating scripts to manage character movement, detecting collision, playing sounds on collisions, destroying objects, increasing and decreasing score and lives and displaying them on screen, managing and loading scenes on events etc.
